We know a tree is a non-linear data structure. It has no limitation on the number of children. A binary tree has a limitation as any node of the tree has at most two children: a left and a right child.



Some terminology of Complete Binary Tree:
Root – Node in which no edge is coming from the parent. Example -node A

Child – Node having some incoming edge is called child. Example – nodes B, H are the child of A and D respectively.

Sibling – Nodes having the same parent are sibling. Example- J, K are siblings as they have the same parent E.

Degree of a node – Number of children of a particular parent. Example- Degree of A is 2 and Degree of H is 1. Degree of L is 0.

Internal/External nodes – Leaf nodes are external nodes and non leaf nodes are internal nodes.

Level – Count nodes in a path to reach a destination node. Example- Level of node H is 3 as nodes A, D and H themselves form the path.

Height – Number of edges to reach the destination node, Root is at height 0. Example – Height of node E is 2 as it has two edges from the root.


What is a Complete Binary Tree?
A complete binary tree is a special type of binary tree where all the levels of the tree are filled completely except the lowest level nodes which are filled from as left as possible.

Perfect Binary Tree :
A binary tree of height ‘h’ having the maximum number of nodes is a perfect binary tree.
